"""Silver — lap times, the pace layer.

One row per driver per lap: position and lap time. This is the finest grain in
the project and the only place that can answer "who was actually fast", as
opposed to "who finished ahead" — a driver can be quicker all afternoon and
still lose the race in the pit lane.

THREE LEVELS OF NESTING, NOT TWO
--------------------------------
Every other endpoint nests twice: a race holds an array of records. Laps nest
three times — a race holds laps, and each lap holds one timing per driver. That
is why `total` reports 1,008 for a 53-lap race with 20 cars, and why the
pagination counter had to learn about Timings specifically.

It also means pages split mid-lap. A 53-lap race comes back as ~61 lap elements
because lap 5's timings can straddle a page boundary, appearing twice with the
same number and different drivers. Deduplicating on (season, round, lap,
driver_id) rather than on the lap element is what makes that a non-event.

LAP TIMES ARE M:SS.mmm, ALWAYS
------------------------------
Unlike pit stop durations, which switch format, a lap time is always
`1:27.623`. It is still parsed rather than cast, because casting returns NULL
and a NULL lap time is indistinguishable from a lap nobody set.
