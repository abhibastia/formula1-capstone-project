"""Silver — measured race-day weather.

One row per race that has an ERA5 observation, typed and quality-checked.

WHY THIS IS A MATERIALIZED VIEW AND NOT AN AUTO CDC TARGET
-----------------------------------------------------------
The facts sourced from Jolpica are candidates for Auto CDC because a result is
provisional when published — stewards apply penalties after the flag and the
payload is reissued. None of that is true here. ERA5 is a reanalysis archive:
once a race day is published the observation does not change, and ingestion
only lands a round after the publication lag has passed, so there is exactly one
snapshot per race. Upsert semantics would buy nothing, and Change Data Feed on a
recomputed view reports every row as changed on every run — noise, not lineage.

CDC and CDF belong where data is amended. This is not that.

ABSENT IS NOT ZERO
------------------
A race with no observation has **no row here**, rather than a row of nulls or —
far worse — a row reading 0.0 mm. Gold left-joins onto this table and reports
the difference explicitly, because "no data" and "no rain" are different answers
and only one of them is safe to put on a dashboard.
