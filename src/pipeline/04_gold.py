"""Gold — business-ready marts.

Both marts join facts to the SCD-2 driver dimension **as of the race date**, so
a 2024 result for a driver who changed teams mid-season is attributed to the
team they actually drove for that weekend, not to their current one. That
as-of join is the reason the SCD-2 dimension exists; a current-row-only join
would silently rewrite history.

Dimensions are kept wide on purpose: every filter the dashboard offers has to
exist as a column here, and it is far easier to aggregate further in a query
than to recover a dimension that was aggregated away.
