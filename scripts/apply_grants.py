WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The README opens by calling this a governed platform. Until this script, that
was a claim with nothing behind it: every object was owner-only by default, and
the only grant in the metastore was the BROWSE that Unity Catalog attaches to a
new catalog on its own. A governance story nobody can query is a slide, not a
control.

PRINCIPALS UNITY CATALOG WILL ACTUALLY ACCEPT
--------------------------------------------
Account-level groups and individual users. **Not workspace-local groups**: this
workspace lists `admins` and `users` under `databricks groups list`, and UC
rejects both with "Could not find principal with name admins". On Free Edition
that leaves `account users` — every user in the account — and named emails.

So the engineer tier is a parameter rather than a hardcoded group. Point it at
an account-level group in a real workspace; leave it unset here and Silver,
Bronze and the landing Volume stay owner-only, which is the correct outcome for
a single-user workspace and still demonstrates the layering.

THE MODEL
---------
Read access narrows as the data gets rawer, which is the whole argument for a
medallion layout:

    account users   Gold only         the marts are the product
    --engineers     + Silver, Bronze  debugging needs the layers below
    owner           everything        the pipeline's run-as identity

An analyst can query `f1.gold.driver_performance` and cannot see the Bronze
payload it came from, or the raw JSON in the landing Volume. That is the
demonstrable half of "governed by Unity Catalog" — not that permissions exist,
but that they differ by layer and you can prove which.

Note that USE CATALOG and USE SCHEMA are traversal, not reading: without them a
SELECT fails even when the table grant is present. Both are granted at the level
above, which is why `account users` gets USE CATALOG on `f1` but no schema
access outside Gold.

WHY NOT THE BUNDLE
------------------
DABs can express grants, but only on securables it owns, and this bundle
deliberately owns neither the catalog nor the schemas — Free Edition refuses
catalog creation over the API, and a `bundle destroy` that dropped the schemas
would take the data with it. Grants follow the objects they sit on, so they live
with `create_catalog.sh` on the scripts side of that boundary.

This uses the Unity Catalog permissions API through the CLI, so it costs no
compute: no warehouse starts, and it works with the daily quota exhausted.
