"""Recompute the season-progress numbers this repo's docs hardcode, and check
they still match.

    python3 scripts/check_doc_counts.py

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`architecture.md`, `runbook.md`, the deck and the README all state real
numbers — round count, lap timings, the quarantine census, reconciliation —
as prose. Those numbers are correct the day they're written and silently wrong
the next race weekend, because the season keeps producing rows. A 2026-08-22
audit found five separate documents still describing a five-Gold-mart, 129-
test platform that had grown a sixth mart and ninety-five more tests months
earlier — nothing failed, nothing flagged it, it was only found by reading
every doc by hand.

This recomputes the same numbers from the local `landing/` raw JSON cache —
no Spark, no warehouse, no compute quota spent — and checks the literal
number each doc currently states against that recomputation. It cannot see a
brand-new *kind* of stale claim, only the ones registered in CLAIMS below; add
a line here whenever a new hardcoded count is added to a doc.

Some claims in these docs (the pace-vs-finish "150 driver-races" finding, the
strategy "0.69 places" finding) depend on Gold-layer computation this script
does not reproduce, because they need real aggregation over `driver_performance`
/ `lap_pace`. Those are listed as informational, not checked — a genuine
audit of them needs a warehouse query or `tests/spark`.

Run this after every pipeline run that lands a new round, before touching any
doc by hand.
