"""Run the correctness checks and fail loudly. The executable half of validation.

    python3 scripts/validate_marts.py --catalog f1        # as a job task
    databricks bundle run f1_end_to_end -t dev            # runs it after the pipeline

`sql/validation_checks.sql` is the narrative version — it explains what each
check proves and why the exemptions are exemptions, and a human reads it. This
file is the same checks with an exit code, so a scheduled run cannot quietly
publish marts that fail them.

It runs on Spark rather than through a SQL warehouse on purpose: the job's
pipeline task has already paid for serverless compute, and going through a
warehouse would start a second one against the same Free Edition daily quota.

Every check declares what it expects. `zero` means the query must return no
rows; `nonzero` means it must return some — SCD-2 history is the check that
fails by being empty, and reporting "0 rows, all clear" for it would invert the
result.
