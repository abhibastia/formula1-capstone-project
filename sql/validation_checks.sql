--                           is what keeps the pace mart about racing.

--                           published without a championship position.

--    duplicate: lap pages split mid-lap, so the same lap number arrives twice
--    with different drivers, and the open round is re-pulled on every run.

-- 9. Lap timings reconcile with the results endpoint. MUST return zero rows.
--
--    Same idea as check 1, one grain down: `laps` and `results` are separate
--    Jolpica endpoints, so the last lap a driver was timed on should be the
--    number of laps the results credit them with. Agreement is evidence the
--    three-level explode and the deduplication are correct.
--
--    Two exemptions, both real semantics rather than tolerance for error:
--
--    Disqualified drivers are excluded. The results endpoint zeroes a
--    disqualified driver's lap count, but the laps they actually drove were
--    still timed — five drivers here, every one of them status 'Disqualified'.
--    Reconciling those to zero would mean deleting laps that happened.
--
--    A one-lap difference is allowed. A lapped runner is classified on the
--    lap the leader finished, so the timing feed holds one more lap than the
--    results credit. Anything beyond one lap is a flattening bug.

-- 10. Every pit stop happened inside the race. MUST return zero rows.
--
--     Cross-endpoint again: the race distance comes from the laps feed, the
--     stops from the pit stop feed. A stop on lap 0, or past the chequered
--     flag, means a round number was mis-parsed and stops were attributed to
--     the wrong race — the failure mode the expectations cannot see, because
--     each row is individually plausible.

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- 11. Every gap in the stop numbering is accounted for. MUST return zero rows.
--
--     Stop numbers should run 1..n per driver per race, and for two driver-
--     races they do not: the highest stop number is larger than the number of
--     stops kept. That is not a lost row — both stops were published with an
--     empty `duration` and the `duration_parsed` expectation moved them to
--     quarantine, where check 6 counts them.
--
--     So the invariant worth asserting is not "no gaps" but "no unexplained
--     gaps": missing stop numbers must equal quarantined stops for that
--     driver-race. A gap without a matching quarantine row means the stop
--     vanished somewhere between Bronze and Silver.
--
--     Consequence worth knowing: gold.race_strategy derives stints as
--     stops + 1 from the rows that survived, so those two driver-races
--     understate stints by one. That is the honest number given a stop with
--     no duration, not a defect to paper over.

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- 12. gold.lap_pace internal arithmetic. MUST return zero rows.
--
--     The pace mart filters, aggregates and then compares against a per-race
--     reference, and each step has an invariant that must survive it: clean
--     laps are a subset of recorded laps, a driver cannot lead more laps than
--     they ran, a median of a set cannot be faster than its minimum, and the
--     reference is the fastest median in the race so no deficit can be
--     negative. Any of these turning up means the 107% filter or the
--     reference join is wrong — which a row count would never reveal.
